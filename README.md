# node-test-bed-adapter

Test-bed adapter for node.js.

# Installation

```console
npm i
npm build
npm run test
```

In order to run the tests continuously on code change, run `npm run watch`. This assumes that you have installed nodemon globally (`npm i -g nodemon`).

## Dependencies

In order to test the application, you need to have a local test-bed running in Docker. Please see [here](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/test-bed) to get it up and running (Docker folder).
